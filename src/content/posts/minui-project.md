summary: "This project started as me wanting to make a terminal-based clone of Tetris, but no TUI library I could find quite fit my requirements. As such, I decided to try making my own (not because it's easy, but because I thought it would be easy). I'm doing this project primarily in Rust so it doubles as a learning exercise."

# Minui: Building a Terminal UI Library

## Project Background

What started as a simple desire to create a Tetris clone evolved into something much more ambitious...

## Technical Challenges

Building a TUI library from scratch presents several interesting challenges:
1. Terminal manipulation and control sequences
2. Event handling
3. Cross-platform compatibility
