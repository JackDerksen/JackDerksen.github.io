      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently in my fourth year at MacEwan University as a computer
        science major, and hope to one day get a software engineering job in
        Montreal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I obsess over details and believe in minimalist results achieved through
        maximum effort. <span class="accent-text">Nicely done.</span>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy working on a wide variety of projects, from terminal-based
        scripts to games and websites like this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm proficient in Python, C, C#, and am currently learning Rust. Check
        out my pinboard page to see what else I'm currently learning and working
        on!
